<p>We sent Carebear, Pogo, and Stitch to Camp Kesem National's annual summit! Here's what they had to say afterwards:</p>
<blockquote>We did a lot of leadership workshops to help us learn how to make camp more successful and it'll definitely help because it gave us a lot of ideas on where to improve and how we can better support the team. - Stitch</blockquote>
