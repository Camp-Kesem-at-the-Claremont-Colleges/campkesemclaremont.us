    <p>Back in May, Camp Kesem at the Claremont Colleges went on a trip to Big Bear in order to get counselors ready for camp. We underwent super intense training and danced the night away after it was all over. Just kidding we actually just played board games. We did however focus on several serious topics ranging from bullying, homesickness, empathy, and more! Overall, we feel really prepared for camp and are confident that the kids will love it too!</p>
