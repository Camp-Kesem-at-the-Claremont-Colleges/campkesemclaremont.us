    <p>The Fall Reunion was a great time with over 15 counselors, alumni, campers, and family in attendance! Campers enjoyed making silly cookie designs, playing board games, and building friendship bracelets! If you couldn't make it, be on the look out for the next reunion.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Kesem On Call!</h2>
<p>We are excited to tell you all about a program we offer to help campers and counselors stay in contact throughout the year! Call on Kesem in an opportunity for us to support our campers in many different ways from tutoring to going to events your child would like us to attend. These can be school plays, concerts, sporting events, or anything else your child is involved in. We would like to offer the opportunity to provide support if your child is having any difficulties and could use a warm word or meeting with the Camp Kesem Family.</p>
<p>We really look forward to seeing more of our Camp families outside of the week of camp. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:claremont.outreach@campkesem.org">claremont.outreach@campkesem.org</a>.</p>
