    <p>Please give a warm welcome to two new members to our coordination team: <strong>Poofy (Co-Volunteer Coordinator)</strong> and <strong>Jelly Bean (Co-AMP Coordinator)</strong>!</p>
    <p>We'd also like to welcome two new advisory board members: <strong>Professor Amy Kind</strong> and <strong>Stevella Lopez</strong>! Professor Kind is a phenomenal philosophy professor at Claremont Mckenna College and heard about Camp Kesem from one of her students! Stevella Lopez is the mother of three of our amazing campers, Pepper, Buggy, and John Cena.</p>

    <h4 class="section-heading-h4">Join the Advisory Board!</h4>
    <p>We're looking for more enthusiastic people to join our chapter's advisory board! Advisory Board members take more responsibility with <strong>fundraising and planning</strong> by meeting with coordinators at least twice a year. If you ever wanted to take a bigger role in helping the Claremont Chapter, this is the way to do it! If you're interested, shoot an email to <a href="mailto:claremont@campkesem.org">claremont@campkesem.org</a>.</p>
